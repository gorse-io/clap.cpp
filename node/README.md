# clap.cpp Node.js bindings

## Install

```sh
npm install clap-cpp
```

## Usage

```js
const { CLAP } = require('clap-cpp');

const model = new CLAP('/path/to/model.gguf', 4);
try {
  const text = model.encodeText('a piano playing'); // owned Float32Array
  const audio = model.encodeAudio('/path/to/audio.wav');
  // CLAP projections are unit-normalized, so their dot product is cosine.
  const similarity = text.reduce((sum, x, i) => sum + x * audio[i], 0);
  console.log(similarity);
} finally {
  model.close(); // optional early release; garbage collection also frees weights
}
```

The package exports only `CLAP`. Its inference API consists of:

- `encodeText(textOrTokens)`: accepts a string, `Int32Array` or `number[]` token IDs.
- `encodeAudio(path, cropOffset = 0)`: decodes WAV/MP3/FLAC by contents, downmixes to mono and automatically resamples for the model.
- `encodeAudio(pcm, sampleRate = 48000, cropOffset = 0)`: accepts mono `Float32Array` samples, with automatic resampling.

Both methods return owned `Float32Array` embeddings. Crop offsets are measured in samples; support depends on the model architecture. `close()` is idempotent; encoding after closing throws.

Inference is synchronous and blocks the calling JavaScript thread. Use a separate model per worker for parallel execution. Tokenization, audio decoding, resampling, frame features and model metadata are not separate public APIs.
